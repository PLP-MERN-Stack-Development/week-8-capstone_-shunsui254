# Name Fields Update Documentation

## Overview
Updated the SignUpPage component to break down the "Full Name" field into separate fields for better user experience and data collection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Interface Update
- **Before**: Single `fullName: string` field
- **After**: Separate fields:
  - `firstName: string` (required)
  - `surname: string` (required)
  - `otherName: string` (optional)

### 2. Form Fields
- **First Name**: Required field with validation (minimum 2 characters)
- **Surname**: Required field with validation (minimum 2 characters)
- **Other Name**: Optional field for middle names or additional names (minimum 2 characters if provided)

### 3. Validation Updates
- Individual validation for each name field
- Required validation for first name and surname
- Optional validation for other name (only validates if provided)
- Proper error messages for each field

### 4. Data Storage
- Individual name fields are stored separately in user object
- A combined `fullName` is generated for display purposes: `"firstName surname otherName"`
- Maintains backward compatibility by including both individual fields and combined name

### 5. User Experience Improvements
- Clearer field labeling with asterisks (*) for required fields
- Helpful placeholder text for each field
- Descriptive help text for the optional "Other Name" field
- Consistent styling with existing form elements

## Benefits

1. **Better Data Quality**: Separate fields ensure proper name formatting
2. **International Support**: Accommodates various naming conventions
3. **Flexibility**: Optional middle name field for users who need it
4. **Validation**: More precise validation for each name component
5. **Professional**: Follows industry standards for user registration forms

## Form Flow
1. User enters First Name (required)
2. User enters Surname (required)
3. User optionally enters Other Name (middle name, additional names)
4. All fields are validated individually
5. Full name is constructed from the separate fields for storage and display

## Technical Details
- Uses existing form validation patterns
- Maintains TypeScript type safety
- Preserves all existing functionality
- No breaking changes to authentication flow
- Compatible with existing user session management
